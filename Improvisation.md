# Authentication API Improvements

## 1. POST `/api/auth/register`

### Issues:
- **Missing input validation:**  
  - Email format is not validated.
  - Password strength is not enforced (should require minimum length, at least one uppercase letter, etc.).
  - Required fields are not strictly checked.

- **Phone Number:**
  - Phone number should be a required field.
  - Must validate that the phone number is Indian (starts with +91 or follows Indian mobile number rules).

- **Date of Birth (DOB):**
  - Include DOB as a required field.

### Fixes:
- Add validation middleware to check:
  - Email format.
  - Password strength (minimum length, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit, one special character).
  - All required fields are present: email, password, phone, DOB, etc.
  - Phone number is Indian.
  - DOB is present and valid.

## 2. POST `/api/auth/logout`

### Issues:
- Not implemented in the current code.
- JWT is stateless; logout is client-side only unless token blacklisting is used.

### Fixes:
- Add a placeholder logout route for the frontend to call (for example, to clear the token on the client).
- For advanced security, implement token blacklisting (store invalidated tokens and check them on each request).

---

## 3. Separate Admin Authentication

### Requirement:
- Create separate login, signup, and logout routes for admin users.

### Fixes:
- Implement `/api/auth/admin/register`, `/api/auth/admin/login`, and `/api/auth/admin/logout` routes.
- Ensure these routes check for and assign the `admin` role appropriately.
- Apply stricter validation and access control for admin endpoints.

# Orders API: Issues & Solutions

## 1. POST `/api/orders` - Create Order

**Issues:**
- No input validation for required fields (services array, scheduledDate, etc.).
- No check if referenced service IDs exist and are active.
- No check for valid quantities (should be positive integers).
- No check for overlapping or conflicting scheduled dates (if relevant).
- No price calculation or verification (client could manipulate price if sent from frontend).
- No user authentication check (should be protected route).

**Solutions:**
- Add validation middleware to check for required fields and correct data types.
- Before creating, verify all service IDs exist and are active.
- Validate that quantities are positive integers.
- Calculate total price on the backend using current service prices.
- Ensure the route is protected and only accessible to authenticated users.

---

## 2. GET `/api/orders` - List Orders

**Issues:**
- No pagination or limit (could return too many orders at once).
- No filtering by user (users should only see their own orders unless admin/staff).
- No validation for query parameters (status, date range, etc.).
- No role-based access control (admins/staff may need to see all orders).

**Solutions:**
- Add pagination and limit query parameters with sensible defaults and maximums.
- Filter orders by the authenticated user unless the requester is admin/staff.
- Validate and sanitize all query parameters.
- Implement role-based access control for broader access.

---

## 3. GET `/api/orders/:id` - Get Order Details

**Issues:**
- No check if the order belongs to the requesting user (unless admin/staff).
- No validation for order ID format (could throw server error).
- No error if order is not found.

**Solutions:**
- Validate order ID format before querying.
- Ensure only the owner or admin/staff can access the order details.
- Return a clear error if the order is not found.

---

## 4. PATCH `/api/orders/:id/status` - Update Order Status

**Issues:**
- No validation for allowed status values (could set to invalid status).
- No check if the order exists before updating.
- No role-based access control (should be restricted to staff/admin).
- No audit logging of status changes.

**Solutions:**
- Validate the new status against a list of allowed values.
- Check if the order exists before updating.
- Restrict access to staff/admin roles.
- Log status changes for auditing.

---

## General Logical Issues

- **No audit logging:** No record of who created/updated orders or status.
- **No input sanitization:** Ensure all inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **No error handling for database failures:** Ensure all DB errors are caught and handled gracefully.
- **No rate limiting on sensitive endpoints:** Consider adding rate limiting to prevent abuse.

**Action Items:**  
- Add validation and sanitization for all inputs.
- Enforce authentication and role-based access.
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
- Document all behaviors and edge cases.

# API Endpoint Issues & Solutions

## Documents API

### 1. POST `/api/documents/upload` - Upload Document

**Issues:**
- No validation for file type or size (could allow malicious uploads or very large files).

**Required Fixes:**
- Restrict file uploads to **PDF** and **JPG** formats only.
- Enforce a **maximum file size of 10MB**.
- Add validation middleware to check file type and size before accepting uploads.

---

### 2. GET `/api/documents/:key` - Get Document

**Issues:**
- No authentication check (should be protected route).
- No authorization check (users should only access their own documents unless admin).

**Required Fixes:**
- Protect the route with authentication middleware.
- Ensure only the owner or an admin can access the requested document.

---

## Checkout API

### 1. POST `/api/checkout/process` - Process Checkout

- No validation for required fields (`orderId`, `paymentMethod`).
- No check if order exists and belongs to the user.
- No check if order is already paid or processed.
- No authentication check (should be protected route).
- No error handling for payment failures.

**Required Fixes:**
- Validate all input fields (`orderId`, `paymentMethod`).
- Check that the order exists and belongs to the authenticated user.
- Ensure the order is not already processed/paid.
- Protect the route with authentication.
- Handle payment gateway errors and return meaningful messages.

---

### 2. POST `/api/checkout/confirm/:orderId` - Confirm Checkout

**Issues:**
- No validation for `paymentIntentId` or other required fields.
- No check if order exists and belongs to the user.

- Handle confirmation errors gracefully.

---

## Webhooks API

### 1. POST `/api/webhook/stripe` - Stripe Webhook Handler

**Issues:**
- No verification of Stripe signature (could allow spoofed requests).
- No validation of event types (should only process known/expected events).

- No idempotency (could process the same event multiple times).

**Required Fixes:**
- Verify Stripe signature on all incoming webhook requests.
- Only process known/expected event types.
- Handle errors gracefully and log failures for investigation.
- Implement idempotency to avoid duplicate processing of the same event.
